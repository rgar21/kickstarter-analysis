# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project:

This project centers around the sorting and analysis of Kickstarter data to find trends in successful and failed campaigns.

### Purpose

The object of this project is to help our client determine what factors can determine a successful fundraising campaign. These factors will help our client determine what parameters to set for the campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

Most of the work with this analysis was sorting the data into meaningful subcategories that could provide specific insight into our clients desired campaign type. Once the data was sorted in subcategories then we were able to comb through the data and filter based on the outcome. Once the outcomes for each campaign were displayed we could dive deeper into determining what factors impacted the successful rate.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The most significant observation that can be made from the line chart is the spike in the success rate from May to August. This is especially evident in the month of May where we can see that more than double the campaigns are successfully funded in comparison to failed campaigns. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Our second line chart named "Outcomes Based on Goal" sought to visualize the relationship between the desired campaign goal and the outcome. We can see that small campaign goals of less than 1000 are fully funded almost 80% of the time. On the opposite end of this chart we can see that campaigns with a goal of 45000 to 49999 are never fully funded.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Most challenges with this project came with the creation and the formatting of our visual aids. Attempting to visualize data into an easily digestible format is paramount when creating projects such as these.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

One conclusion that can be drawn from the "Launch Date" chart is the overwhelming success of campaigns in the month of May. Another conclusion would be the low success rate of campaigns in the months of November and December. Given these insights we would highly recommend our client to launch their campaign in the month of May.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on this line chart we would recommend our client set their fundraising goal from either $100-$10000 or increase their goal all the way to $35000-45000. This would put our client at an estimated 60% success rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some limitations of this dataset are the outliers from faux campaigns that can skew the general data set. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Another possible graph would revolve around diving deeper into the successful campaigns in May. We could gain a better understanding of these May campaigns by filtering the goal amount in order to gain better insight into what our clients fundraising goal should be.
